Plant Class in Java
1.The Plant class represents a plant with attributes like name, type, height, water needs, and temperature tolerance. This class is designed to simulate a simple plant entity with the ability to display its details and perform an action such as watering the plant.

2.Attributes
name: The name of the plant (e.g., "Rose").
type: The type or species of the plant (e.g., "Dutch rose").
height: The height of the plant in centimeters.
waterNeeds: The daily water needs of the plant in liters.
temperatureTolerance: The temperature range in degrees Celsius that the plant can tolerate.

3.Methods
displayInfo(): Prints the plant's details in a formatted manner.
waterPlant(double waterAmount): This method simulates watering the plant by subtracting the given water amount from its daily water needs. It updates the water needs and provides feedback on whether the plant has been watered sufficiently or still needs more water.

4.How to Use
Clone the repository or download the source files.
Compile and run the Main.java file to test the functionality.
Three sample plants are created and displayed using the displayInfo() method.
The waterPlant() method is called to simulate watering a plant. The method will update the plant's water needs and print the remaining amount of water required, if any.

5.Output example:
Plant Name: Daisy
Plant Type: Gerber
Plant Height: 45 cm
Plant WaterNeeds: 0.2 liters/day
Plant TemperatureTolerance: 10째C - 40째C
Daisy still needs 0.1 liters of water.
Plant Name: Daisy
Plant Type: Gerber
Plant Height: 45 cm
Plant WaterNeeds: 0.1 liters/day
Plant TemperatureTolerance: 10째C - 40째C
